1.what is platform independence?
    java is platform independence because write ones run anywhere that means you write java code in windows
	and run other platform like [unix,mac] 
	Actually  byte code platform independence
	
 2.what are diff b/w primitive and non primitive datatype?
  datatype means what type of data store in is called datatype.....
example :int means only integer value store ......
          String means charter only store.....
		  there are tow type of data 
		  1.primative  (fixed size)
		  2.nan primitive(its not fixed size)
		* primitive :
		    there are 8 type data
			datatype   default value  memory
			byte :           0         1 byte  8 bhit
			shor :           0         2 byte  16 bhit
			int:             0         4 byte  32 bhit
			long :           0l        8 byte  64 bhit
			float:           0.0f      4 byte  32 bhit
			double:          0.0       8 byte  64 bhit
			char:                      2 byte  16 bhit 
			Boolean:         false              1 bhit
		* non primitive :
		   there are 'n' number  in built keywords first later is upper case Compulsory
		    String Class.....etc
 3. Explain class and its member with example?
    * class is a bule print of object.
	* class is combination of states and behaviours.	
	Syntax:
	 public class Akash{
		 
	 }
	its member with example?
	1.contructor: contractor name and class name should be same,, and  there is no return type
	example: class A{
		a(){
			
		}
	}
	2.variables: It is register area allocated for memory (or) it is container store the data
   eg: int a=10;	
	3.methads: method is block of code for execution  specific task
	eg: static int main(){
		return;
		
	}
	
6. Explain main method with the memory its execute?
    
	Public static void main(String args[]){
		public is access modifier.
		static is nan access modifier
		void mens there no return type,
		main start execution with  a main method,
		String args[]:command line argument
	}
	program execution is jvm in java 
	there main 3 task
	1.load byte code ;
	2.verfiy byte code;
	3.exuaction byte code;
	finally display output of the code
