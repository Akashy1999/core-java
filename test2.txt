1)Explian 
JRE:java runtime enivornament
JDK:java Devlopment kit
JVM:java vircutial machine
    *program execution is jvm in java  its platform independent
	there main 3 task
	1.load byte code ;
	2.verfiy byte code;
	3.exuaction byte code;
	finally display output of the code


2)Explian the following
1)class:
* class is a bule print of object.
	* class is combination of states and behaviours.	
	Syntax:
	 public class Akash{
		 
	 }
	its member with example?
	1.contructor: contractor name and class name should be same,, and  there is no return type
	example: class A{
		a(){
			
		}
	}
*object:
     *Instance variable store in Object.and non static variable store in object 
object is creation using class name with any referance variable
   example: organization org=new arganization();
//org is referance og object in using the code
*static:
 static is non access modifier its use you wirte code in the  insiade the class some create static variable and direcatly print  inside main methad without object creation
*public :
  public is access modifier and it willaccess any were in system
  example: Public static void main(String args[])
*private:private keyword is using only in saide the class only access
  example: private String org(){}
* 2)Public static void main(String args[]){
		public is access modifier.
		static is non access modifier
		void mens there no return type,
		main start execution with  a main method,
		String args[]:command line argument
	}
*3)System.out.println();
    it will write with double qoutes and it will be  print
example:System.out.println("hi hello");
output:hi hello
3)what is array?
   array is a gruop of element its collecation of homegenoues element.
   array statrt with index value zero
example:
int a[]={1,3,5,7,9};
6)what is variable?
  variables: It is register area allocated for memory (or) it is container store the data
   eg: int a=10;
  its type:
  * static variable
     static variable and direcatly print  inside main methad without object creation
  * non static variable: object creation is complsory 
  * local variable:variable ceration its main rule declarition and insalization is complsory
4)write a program
5)Explian dtatype in java?
  datatype means what type of data store in is called datatype.....
example :int means only integer value store ......
          String means charter only store.....
		  there are tow type of data 
		  1.primative  (fixed size)
		  2.nan primitive(its not fixed size)
		* primitive :
		    there are 8 type data
			datatype   default value  memory
			byte :           0         1 byte  8 bhit
			shor :           0         2 byte  16 bhit
			int:             0         4 byte  32 bhit
			long :           0l        8 byte  64 bhit
			float:           0.0f      4 byte  32 bhit
			double:          0.0       8 byte  64 bhit
			char:                      2 byte  16 bhit 
			Boolean:         false              1 bhit
		* non primitive :
		   there are 'n' number  in built keywords first later is upper case Compulsory
		    String Class.....etc
8)fucher in java?
   *simple and sacure
   *highlevel
   *protable
   *Roubest
   *multitherading
   *automatic garbage collecation

9)write once run any were?
java is platform independence because write ones run anywhere that means you write java code in windows
	and run other platform like [unix,mac] 
	Actually  byte code platform independence
12)write a program given reverce number
public class Interview {
 public static void reverce(int b[]) {
	 for(int i=b.length-1;i>=0;i--) {	 
    	System.out.print(b[i]);
	 }
 }
 public static void main(String[] args) {
	 int b[]= {2,3,4,6,7};
	 reverce(b);	
}
}
output:76432
13)write a progarm Fact?
public class fact {
	public static void main(String args[]){  
		  int i,fact=1;  
		  int number=10;//It is the number to calculate factorial    
		  for(i=1;i<=number;i++){    
		      fact=fact*i;    
		  }    
		  System.out.println("Factorial of "+number+" is: "+fact);    
		 }  
}
output:Factorial of 10 is: 3628800
14) sum number
public class Sum {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	int a=2;
	int b=3;
	int c=4;
	int d=a+b+c;
	System.out.println("output is "+d);
	
	}
}
output is 9
